General Information
===================

On this page you will find general information about the project.

The philosophy
--------------

The project's guiding principle is to give researchers a straightforward framework that is simple to utilize.

This framework includes built-in MedQuery certifications, eliminating the need to manually add them for every project.

The framework also has the usual packages like poetry, CUDA etc. installed, so you can start working on your project right away.

The framework is also designed to be easily extensible, so you can add your own packages and certifications as you see fit, which in turn will modulerize into the production pipeline.

Another aspect of the framework is that it is easier to have a common understanding of how it all operates both for experiments and in production through regular documentation and code updates.

The idea is also for researchers to add issues in the Github repository if there is any changes they would like to see in the framework, so that the framework can be improved over time and if there are any bugs or limitations.
